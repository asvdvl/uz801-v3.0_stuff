# uz801-v3.0_stuff
this repository was created because I could not find the original firmware for the specified modem. so I created this repository similar to [this repository](https://github.com/Mio-sha512/openstick-stuff). As I know, firmware from version 2.1 is not quite suitable for it, so I will post everything that works in [releases](https://github.com/asvdvl/uz801-v3.0_stuff/releases).
